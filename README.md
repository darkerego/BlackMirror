# About Blackmirror


<p>
<b>The Case for Blackmirror's Existence</b>


This a tool for semi-automated trading on [FTX](https://ftx.com/profile#a=blackmirror). I created it because I was tired 
of loosing money because I was getting distracted and having to leave the computer without having set a top loss, and 
tired of missing opportunities to take profit for the same reason. Initially, the idea was to create a fully automated 
trade platform, however at some point I decided to begin focusing on making the system more targeted towards 
"Semi-Automating the Manual Trade Process" -- Which is why the repo is called "SemiAuto Trader", despite the fact that 
the bot is actually called "Blackmirror". However, as time went on (and I have been developing this thing 
for *years* ...), the project took yet another direction, and now I am working on making this a fully automated system 
again ... 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Case for Open Sourcing This Project </b>

I open sourced this project for three reasons ... First of all, I think this is some of my better work, and figured it 
would look good on my resume (I am available for hire - xelectron at protonmail dot com). Next, and more importantly - 
I had hoped that by giving this software away, people that found it useful may support my work by using my 
[FTX Referral](https://ftx.com/profile#a=blackmirror) link. So far, that hasn't happened, but you never know. Finally, 
the *most* important reason that I open sourced this project is because this is only half of the project: 
In development for several years now is a very powerful trade signal engine. It is now nearly completed and in the 
beta testing phase. In the very near future, I will be selling subscriptions to my trade signals which can be consumed 
by this bot via mqtt. So, in the meantime -- stay tuned, and enjoy. Remember, if you found this work useful, please 
consider supporting me by using my [FTX Referral](https://ftx.com/profile#a=blackmirror) code!

### Demo of Bot Taking Profit
https://asciinema.org/a/464734

### AutoTrader Features:

Autotrader is the "backbone" of the program. This is my signature feature, and the one I am most proud of 
and find the most useful. Personally I think it is one the coolest things I have written. It assumes multiple functions, 
from guilded semi-automatic  trading (doing thing like taking profit and setting stops). 
It also has the ability to reopen a position after taking profit. This can be done either incrementally, or all at once. 
Most of these options are the same as in the last release, with the notable exception is `--close_method`. 
This is a lot like `-reopen`. Essentially you can choose to take profit in increments, potentially maximizing your gains.
It is the same idea as "pyramiding" your orders. But now, it happens automatically. 


- Automatic take profit
  - take profit via trailingstop
  - market order
  - limit order
  - incrementally take profit via a series of pyramid limit orders
  - Automatic stop loss
    - If you forget to set one, the program will handle it for you
- Automatically reopen your position
   - via limit, market, or incrementally (see incremental orders section below)

These features allow you to set a position and walk away from your screen, perhaps even 
go to sleep in peace! 

### API Functionality Features:
- Buy and sell
- Cancel orders
- View portfolio
- Get deposit addresses
- "Order chase" - keep your limit order on top of the order book
- Get open orders
- Set account leverage

#### Incremental Orders
- The process is:
  - Bot calculates the standard deviation over the last user supplied period (default 5 minutes)
  - Then the bot sets take profit limit sell orders up the book in this range (for a long)
  - Next, the bot sets limit buy orders orders to reopen your position going down the book in this range (for a long)
  - vice versa for a short
- Example: 
  - $1000 long BTC-PERP entered at 39000 hits target profit of .1% at $40000 - , so your position is now worth $1100
  - Standard deviation for the last 5 minutes is $50 - so it is likely that BTC will move that much again over the next 5 minutes
  - So, we set take profit orders like this:
    - Sell $60.31 at 40012.5
    - Sell $120.63 at 40025.0
    - Sell $250.25 at 40037.5
    - Sell $500.5 at 40050.0
  - This way, your average take profit price increases. This allows your sort of "trade the natural volatility"
  - The same thing happens in reverse when we reopen our position:
    - Buy $60.31 at $39987.5
    - Buy $120.63 at $39975.0
    - Buy $250.25 at $39962.5
    - Buy $500 at $39950.0
<p> This way, your average entry price of your now re-opened long position averages down as the market drops. 
However, you also have the option to sell a percentage of your position when you take profit. I think this is better, because then your stop loss moves up as the market rises (I like to take 25% profit when I hit my target which is usually 0.25%) I prefer to do this because if you set your take profit to say .5% and your stop loss to .25% , then as you buy and sell, your stop will end up moving with your position - because the bot will be calculating this including whatever gains you have made. Sort of like how you cannot really loose if you set your stop loss right before your entry after a successful trade. </p>


![incremental orders](doc/incremental_tp_reopen.png)
<p> Example of running autotrader with incremental take profit and reopen enabled. Each downward pointing arrow is the bot partially taking profit on a long, and each upward pointing arrow is the bot partially reopening the position. </p>


### Websocket and Mqtt Receivers (W.I.P.)
<p>Bot also supports consumption of trade signals over both mqtt and websockets. The format for 
signal consumption is: </p>

### Experimental Built in Strategy
<p><b> WARNING -- 

**The oscillation arbitrage engine and experimental sar strategy are broken right now, do not use them. 
You WILL lose money if you do.**</b>
</p>
<p>
With that said ... 

Introducing a new feature - a technical analysis framework, built to be modular such that we can author our 
own indicators and have a plug and play system to use with the trade engine. Currently, I have only written one 
indicator, which is multi timeframe slightly modified version of the parabolic sar indicator, which is included 
in this codebase. The idea is to start the program with no current open positions. The TA engine will enter trades 
when opportune, and the trade engine will take over from there. So, if you are going to use the experimental 
sar algo, then you may want to run it with `-ds` and without `--reopen`, because we do not want to reopen the 
position unless we are getting a valid trade signal. Rather we want positions to be opened by the TA engine, 
and then we want the trade engine to take profit when the `-tp` specified level is achieved. A trailing stop 
is good to use in this situation. It is enabled by default, so you don't need to worry about that. Do keep in 
mind that this is ALPHA software and your mileage may vary.

Example command to start up the SAR algo:
<pre>
$ ./main.py -a -tp 1 -ts .25 -sl .5 -sy ETH-PERP -sym ETHUSDT -xs .1
</pre>

<p>
Breakdown of command:

Start autotrader. Set take profit to 1%. Set trailing stop offset to .25% , set stop loss to .5% , trade on 
ftx with ETH-PERP futures, but monitor the binance ETHUSDT market to generate those signals. When entering a 
trade, enter with a size of .1 etherum.
