# SemiAuto


# Rational For Existance

I decided to open source this. It is a very featured tool for the FTX trading platform that I wrote to semi automate the manual trade process. It is part of a larger project, a fully automated system in development. I wrote this to stop forgetting to set stop losses and missing oppurtunities to take profit in my sleep. It can also take profit in increments, pyramiding up and down the books as you take profit, and then re-enter, essentially just swing trading 
the volatility. It is really cool to watch. I will post some asciinema soon. The documentation should be decent. To get started, run:

```
./autotrade.py -ma
```
